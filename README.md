# D-Word-Password-Manager
A local, encrypted, terminal based password manager built on top of a beautiful Terminal GUI layer.

D-Word is built on top of TermUI and requires it, you can get it from TestPyPi here: https://test.pypi.org/project/TermUI/1.2.0/ or you can get the files from the github here: https://github.com/iiVeil/TermUI

D-Word has 2 dependencies `TermUI`, and `cryptography`.

If you do not get TermUI from TestPyPi you will need to install `windows-curses` via pip if you are on windows.
