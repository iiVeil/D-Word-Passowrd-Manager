# D-Word-Password-Manager
A local, encrypted, terminal based password manager.

D-Word is built on top of TermUI (https://github.com/iiVeil/TermUI) and uses a local import of it, just download TermUI aswell and drop the files in a folder called `TermUI` and put that folder in the same directory as the main

This project also acts as an unofficial documentation of the TermUI library. It has no documentation yet, and probably never will.

It is lightly commented and any developer worth their salt will be able to understand and use the library if they'd please.
